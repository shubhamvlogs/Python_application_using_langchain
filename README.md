# Python Application with LangChain: Content Search

Welcome to the documentation for a Python application that utilizes LangChain to search for content based on prompts provided by the user. This application demonstrates how to leverage the power of natural language processing (NLP) and LangChain, a state-of-the-art language model, to retrieve relevant information based on user input.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- LangChain API credentials (API key or access token)

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-repo
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install the project dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To configure the application to use LangChain, you need to provide your API credentials. Open the `config.py` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```python
# LangChain API credentials
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The application will prompt you to enter your query. Type in your question or prompt, and press Enter. The program will process the input and retrieve relevant content using LangChain.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the application according to your needs. You can modify the code in the `main.py` file to handle user input differently or add additional functionalities.

You can also explore the LangChain API documentation to understand its capabilities better and make more advanced queries.
